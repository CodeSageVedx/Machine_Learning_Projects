# Student Performance Prediction

## Overview
This project is a **Student Performance Prediction** system that utilizes a **Linear Regression** model to predict an individual's performance based on a CSV dataset containing student records. The project features a user-friendly **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built with **Streamlit** and is deployed on **Streamlit servers** for easy access and usage.

##Deployed Link :-
https://machinelearningprojects-1.streamlit.app/

## Features
- **Upload Student Data**: Users can upload their data for analysis.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The application processes the CSV file and prepares it for the ML model.
- **Linear Regression Model**: Predicts student performance based on input features.
- **Visualizations**: Displays various graphical representations of data insights.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Streamlit-based interactive interface.
- **Deployed on Streamlit**: Accessible online without local setup.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-Learn** (for Linear Regression)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for Data Visualization)

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-performance-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd student-performance-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the deployed **Streamlit App** using the provided link.
2. The application will process the data and apply the **Linear Regression Model**.
3. View the **predicted performance** and **visualizations**.
4. Analyze results and insights derived from the dataset.

## Dataset Format
The CSV file should contain the following columns (example):
- `Hours Studied`
- `Previous Scores`
- `Attendance Percentage`
- `Extra Activities`
- `Final Score` (Target variable for training)

## Deployment
The application is deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**. You can access the live version here:
